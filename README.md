## Laboratory 3 - OOP

### Description

This simulation is supposed to represent some simple natural environment with generalized elements  
The simulation will mostly rely on interactions between the different entities

#### Entities:

* Tile - The most essential entity, most other entities reside on it. Has 3 main attributes:  
	- Water - The quanitity of water in the area. Sustains life.
	- Temperature - Influences water evaporation
	- Altitude - Influences water flow and precipitation
Tiles also store the information regarding what kind of entity is currently on it
* Cloud - An entity that helps redistribute water across Tiles, behaves differently to the Tile's water flow  
* Plant - The most common lifeform, grows on tiles with enough water and proper heat
* Tree - A "grown up" plant, generates food for other animals and a small amount of clouds via transpiration
* Fungi - Similar to Plants, require more humidity and can feed on the dead
* Corpses - The remains of a deceased animal. Can be used as a food source for other entities
* Animals:
	- Detritivores - Animals that feed from the dead
	- Herbivores - Animals that feed from plants
	- Carnivores - Animals that feed from other animals, tend to be more aggressive
	- Omnivores - Animals that feed from any of the above, less aggressive than carnivores but can still attack other animals
	
Inheritance has been added in the following way:

### Progress:

Fungi now spawn and consume water, appear visible on the Entity map  
Trees are now made to interact with the medium
Some adjustments have been made to make the simulation faster and evolve for longer  

No animals & corpses are spawned, as they need some bugfixing and modification of their methods  
Running the program will print out the existing landscape inside the terminal in multiple sections:  
![Program execution screenie](/images/Terminal.png)  

The intensity of the colors above directly correspond to an increase in quantity of something  
**Caution!** Make sure the program output fits inside the terminal window, or you will have a nasty trace left on-screen  
For now, the program can only end execution with Ctrl+C.  
The colors have been added via ANSI escape codes.
